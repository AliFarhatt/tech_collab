This system puts forward a mechanism to detect color and sort items through image processing. Once identified, a mechanism is used to sort the candies into particular bins/baskets. We demonstrate this mechanism using a camera with electronic circuitry along with a sorting mechanism using 3 bins. The system uses a Raspberry Pi connected to a controller circuit to achieve this task. The controller circuit consists of a camera that detects the color of a small object in front of it. A motor is used to feed an object to the camera chamber. As soon as the color is detected, a signal is sent to the sorter mechanism, which uses a motor to position the sorting tube towards the respective section. A feeder is then used to push the object towards the tubs so that it gets sorted and the next object is pulled in by the feeder. The action details are sent to the IOT server using IOTGecko platform to keep track of the number of objects sorted in each section. Thus, we achieve a completely automated IOT-based sorting system.",

        "description": "When it comes to old age, it becomes necessary to monitor our old ones for their health and safety. Due to weakness and weak joints they have a great risk of falling down. Now it is important to know if an old age person has fallen so that he/she can be helped on time. Also people on wheelchair need to be checked for fall detection. For this purpose we propose a smart fall detection system. The system uses accelerometer and gyro sensor to detect person movements, It can be mounted on persons hand or wheelchair for detection.",
