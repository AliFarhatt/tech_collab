        "description": "The Diabetes disease Heart disease (HD) has been considered as one of the complex and life deadliest human diseases in the world. In Heart disease, usually the heart is unable to push the required amount of blood to other parts of the body to fulfill the normal functionalities of the body, and due to this, ultimately the heart failure occurs. The rate of heart disease in the United States is very high. The symptoms of heart disease include shortness of breath, weakness of physical body, swollen feet, and fatigue with related signs, for example, elevated jugular venous pressure and peripheral edema caused by functional cardiac or noncardiac abnormalities. The investigation techniques in early stages used to identify heart disease were complicated, and\u2026",

However by analysing the revenues generated by previous movies, a model can be built which can help us predict the expected revenue for a particular movie. Such a prediction could be very useful for the movie studios which will be producing the movie so they can decide on different expenses like artist compensations, advertising of the movie, promotions in various cities, etc. accordingly.

Data mining is a powerful technology with great potential to extract knowledge based information from such data. Prediction can be done with past and related records in different fields. Risk and safety have always been an important consideration in the field of aircraft. Prediction of accident in aircraft will save life and cost. This paper proposes an accident prediction system with huge collection of past records by applying effective predictive data mining techniques like Decision Tree (DT) and Naive Bayes which have a greater capacity to handle huge and noisy data that are used to predict accidents with more accuracy.

Collaborative is often the preferred approach as it requires no domain knowledge and no feature gathering effort. The 2 primary methods for collaborative filtering are latent factor models and neighborhood methods. In user-user neighborhood methods, similarity between users is measured by transforming them into the item space. Similar logic applies to item-item similarity. In latent factor methods, both user and items are transformed into a latent feature space. An item is recommended to a user if they are similar, their vector representation in the latent feature space is relatively high. We select latent factor model because it allows us to identify the hidden feature of the users. These features are time independent.",

On-line recognition involves live transformation of character written by a user on a tablet or a smart phone. In contrast, off-line recognition is more challenging, which requires automatic conversion of scanned image or photos into a computer-readable text format. Motivated by the interesting application of off-line recognition technology, for instance the USPS address recognition system, and the Chase QuickDeposit system, this project will mainly focus on discovering algorithms that allow accurate, fast, and efficient character recognition process.

        "description": "In mobile communication, spatial queries pose a serious threat to user location privacy because the location of a query may reveal sensitive information about the mobile user. In this paper, we study approximate k nearest neighbor (KNN) queries where the mobile user queries the location-based service (LBS) provider about approximate k nearest points of interest (POIs) on the basis of his current location. We propose a basic solution and a generic solution for the mobile user to preserve his location and query privacy in approximate kNN queries. The proposed solutions are mainly built on the Paillier public-key cryptosystem and can provide both location and query privacy. To preserve query privacy, our basic solution allows the mobile user to retrieve\u2026",

        "description": "In recent years, big online social media data have found many applications in the intersection of political and computer science. Examples include answering questions in political and social science (e.g., proving/disproving the existence of media bias and the \u201cecho chamber\u201d effect), using online social media to predict election outcomes, and personalizing social media feeds so as to provide a fair and balanced view of people\u2019s opinions on controversial issues. A prerequisite for answering the above research questions is the ability to accurately estimate the political leaning of the population involved. If it is not met, either the conclusion will be invalid, the prediction will perform poorly due to a skew towards highly vocal\u2026",

        "description": "In recent years, shopping online is becoming more and more popular. When it needs to decide whether to purchase a product or not online, the opinions of others become important. It presents a great opportunity to share our viewpoints for various products purchase. However, people face the information overloading problem. How to mine valuable information from reviews to understand a user\u2019s preferences and make an accurate recommendation is crucial. Traditional recommender systems consider some factors, such as user\u2019s purchase records, product category, and geographic location. In this work, it proposes a sentiment-based rating prediction method to improve prediction accuracy in recommender systems. Firstly, it proposes a social user sentimental measurement approach and calculates each user\u2019s sentiment on items. Secondly, it not only\u2026",

A query may have multiple facets that summarize the information about the query from different perspectives.

The query \u201cvisit Beijing\u201d has a facet about popular resorts in Beijing (Tiananmen square, forbidden city, summer palace, ...) and a facet on several travel-related topics (attractions, shopping, dining, ...).

Unfortunately, hackers have realized the potential of using apps for spreading malware and spam. The problem is already significant, as we find that at least 13% of apps in our dataset are malicious. So far, the research community has focused on detecting malicious posts and campaigns. In this paper, we ask the question: Given a Facebook application, can we determine if it is malicious? Our key contribution is in developing FRAppE-Facebook's Rigorous Application Evaluator-arguably the first tool focused on detecting malicious apps on Facebook. To develop FRAppE, we use information gathered by observing the posting behavior of 111K Facebook apps seen across 2.2 million users on Facebook.",

Cloud computing infrastructures offer an effective support for addressing both the computational and data storage needs of big data mining applications. In fact, complex data mining tasks involve data- and compute-intensive algorithms that require large and efficient storage facilities together with high-performance processors to get results in acceptable times. In this chapter, we present a Data Mining Cloud Framework designed for developing and executing distributed data analytics applications as workflows of services. In this environment, we use datasets, analysis tools, data mining algorithms and knowledge models that are implemented as single services that can be combined through a visual programming interface.",

Specifically, such data reveal who spends time where, when, and on what type of activity (e.g., shopping at a mall, or dining at a restaurant). That information can, in turn, be used to describe city regions in terms of activity that takes place therein. For example, the data might reveal that citizens visit one region mainly for shopping in the morning, while another for dining in the evening. Furthermore, once such a description is available, one can ask more elaborate questions. For example, one might ask what features distinguish one region from another - some regions might be different in terms of the type of venues they have, the demographics of their visitors, or the times of day they are most active.",
