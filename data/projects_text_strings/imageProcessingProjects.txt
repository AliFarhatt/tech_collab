"Identifying Gender From Facial Features. Previous research has shown that our brain has specialized nerve cells responding to specific local features of a scene, such as lines, edges, angles or movement. Our visual cortex combines these scattered pieces of information into useful patterns. Automatic face recognition aims to extract these meaningful pieces of information and put them together into a useful representation in order to perform a classification/identification task on them. While we attempt to identify gender from facial features, we are often curious about what features of the face are most important in determining gender. Are localized features such as eyes, nose and ears more important or overall features such as head shape, hairline and face contour more important? There are a plethora of successful and robust face... , Image Processing, AI ",
"Object Detection for Semantic SLAM using Convolution Neural Networks. Conventional SLAM (Simultaneous Localization and Mapping) systems typically provide odometry estimates and point-cloud reconstructions of an unknown environment. While these outputs can be used for tasks such as autonomous navigation, they lack any semantic information. Our project implements a modular object detection framework that can be used in conjunction with a SLAM engine to generate semantic scene reconstructions. A semantically-augmented reconstruction has many potential applications. Some examples include: � Discriminating between pedestrians, cars, bicyclists, etc in an autonomous driving system. � Loop-closure detection based on object-level descriptors. � Smart household bots that can retrieve objects given a natural language command. An object detection algorithm designed for these applications has a unique set of requirements and constraints. The algorithm needs to be... , Image Processing, AI ",
"Application of Neural Network In Handwriting Recognition. Handwriting recognition can be divided into two categories, namely on-line and off-line handwriting recognition. On-line recognition involves live transformation of character written by a user on a tablet or a smart phone. In contrast, off-line recognition is more challenging, which requires automatic conversion of scanned image or photos into a computer-readable text format. Motivated by the interesting application of off-line recognition technology, for instance the USPS address recognition system, and the Chase QuickDeposit system, this project will mainly focus on discovering algorithms that allow accurate, fast, and efficient character recognition process.

"With many potential practical applications, content-based image retrieval (CBIR) has attracted substantial attention during the past few years. A variety of relevance feedback (RF) schemes have been developed as a powerful tool to bridge the semantic gap between low-level visual features and high-level semantic concepts, and thus to improve the performance of CBIR systems. Among various RF approaches, support-vector-machine (SVM)-based RF is one of the most popular techniques in CBIR. Despite the success, directly using SVM as an RF scheme has two main drawbacks. First, it treats the positive and negative feedbacks equally, which is not appropriate since the two groups of training feedbacks have distinct properties. Second, most of the SVM-based RF techniques do not take into account the... , Image Processing ",
