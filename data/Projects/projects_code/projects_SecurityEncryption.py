    "description": "Elliptical curve cryptography (ECC) is a public key encryption technique based on elliptic curve theory that can be used to create faster, smaller, and more efficient cryptographic keys. ECC generates keys through the properties of the elliptic curve equation instead of the traditional method of generation as the product of very large prime numbers. The technology can be used in conjunction with most public key encryption methods, such as RSA, and Diffie-Hellman. Here in this project we have two entities- User and Admin. The admin will manage users. The admin can upload and share files with a particular user. The uploaded file will be encrypted using AES algorithm. Users can then decode the shared file using the decryption key.",
