    "description": "The Diabetes disease Heart disease (HD) has been considered as one of the complex and life deadliest human diseases in the world. In Heart disease, usually the heart is unable to push the required amount of blood to other parts of the body to fulfill the normal functionalities of the body, and due to this, ultimately the heart failure occurs. The rate of heart disease in the United States is very high. The symptoms of heart disease include shortness of breath, weakness of physical body, swollen feet, and fatigue with related signs, for example, elevated jugular venous pressure and peripheral edema caused by functional cardiac or noncardiac abnormalities. The investigation techniques in early stages used to identify heart disease were complicated, and…",

However by analysing the revenues generated by previous movies, a model can be built which can help us predict the expected revenue for a particular movie. Such a prediction could be very useful for the movie studios which will be producing the movie so they can decide on different expenses like artist compensations, advertising of the movie, promotions in various cities, etc. accordingly.

The 2 primary methods for collaborative filtering are latent factor models and neighborhood methods. In user-user neighborhood methods, similarity between users is measured by transforming them into the item space. Similar logic applies to item-item similarity. In latent factor methods, both user and items are transformed into a latent feature space. An item is recommended to a user if they are similar, their vector representation in the latent feature space is relatively high. We select latent factor model because it allows us to identify the hidden feature of the users. These features are time independent.",

A recent article claims that drivers cruising for a parking spot in SF generate 30% of all downtown congestion. These wasted miles not only increase traffic congestion, but also lead to more pollution and driver anxiety. In order to alleviate this problem, the city armed 7000 metered parking spaces and 12,250 garages spots with sensors and introduced a mobile application called SFpark, which provides real-time information about the availability of a parking lot to drivers. However,…",

    "description": "Short-term prediction of stock price trend has potential application for personal investment without high-frequency-trading infrastructure. Unlike predicting market index (as explored by previous years’ projects), a single stock price tends to be affected by large noise and long-term trend inherently converges to the company’s market performance. So this project focuses on short-term (1-10 days) prediction of stock price trend and takes the approach of analyzing the time series indicators as features to classify trend (Raise or Down). The validation model is chosen so that the testing set always follows the training set in the time span to simulate real prediction. Cross-validated Grid Search on parameters of RBF-kernelized SVM is performed to fit the training data to balance the bias and variances.",

In latent factor methods, both user and items are transformed into a latent feature space.

    "description": "Irregularity in heartbeat may be harmless or life-threatening. Hence both accurate detection of the presence, as well as classification of arrhythmia, are important. Arrhythmia can be diagnosed by measuring the heart activity using an instrument called ECG or electrocardiograph and then analyzing the recorded data. Different parameter values can be extracted from the ECG waveforms and can be used along with other information about the patient like age, medical history, etc., to detect arrhythmia. However, sometimes it may be difficult for a doctor to look at these long-duration ECG recordings and find minute irregularities. Therefore, using machine learning for automating arrhythmia diagnosis can be very helpful. The project aims at using different machine learning algorithms like Naive Bayes, SVM, Random Forests, and Neural Networks.",

Sharing on the web has become a major tool in expressing customer thoughts about a particular product or service. Recent years have seen rapid growth in online discussion groups and review sites (e.g., www.tripadvisor.com) where a crucial characteristic of a customer’s review is their sentiment or overall opinion — for example, if the review contains words like ‘great’, ‘best’, ‘nice’, ‘good’, ‘awesome’ is probably a positive comment. Whereas if reviews contain words like ‘bad’, ‘poor’, ‘awful’, ‘worse’ is probably a negative review. However, Trip Advisor’s star rating does not express the exact experience of the customer. Most of the ratings are meaningless, a large chunk of reviews falls in the middle.",

Social media tools like Twitter are increasingly used by individuals to broadcast their day-to-day happenings or to report on an external event of interest. Understanding the rich landscape of moods will help us better interpret millions of individuals. This paper describes a Rule-Based approach, which detects the emotion or mood of the tweet and classifies the twitter message under the appropriate emotional category. The accuracy of the system is 85%. With the proposed system it is possible to understand the deeper levels of emotions, i.e., finer-grained instead of sentiment, i.e., coarse-grained. The sentiment says whether the tweet is positive or negative.",

Large databases of such scenes have become available in recent years as a result of improvements in the ease of use of tools for 3D scene design. A system that can identify a 3D scene from a natural language description is useful for making such databases of scenes readily accessible. Natural language has evolved to be well-suited to describing our (three-dimensional) world, and it provides a convenient way of specifying the space of acceptable scenes.",

Over the last two decades, several studies have explored the use of EEG signals to predict seizures using principles from machine learning. It is thought that such an algorithm could be implemented in real-time with a wireless, implanted EEG sensor. However, there are two main constraints for such a portable system. First, due to limited battery life, energy consumption must be minimal. Second, due to limited bandwidth, the data transmitted between the sensor and the central processing device (such as mobile phone, tablet, personal computer, etc.) should be minimal.",

This paper tackles the problem of processing top-K queries over uncertain data with the help of crowdsourcing to quickly converge to the real ordering of relevant results. Several offline and online approaches for addressing questions to a crowd are defined and contrasted on both synthetic and real datasets, with the aim of minimizing the crowd interactions necessary to find the real ordering of the result set.",

Machine learning techniques make automatic detection of bullying messages in social media possible, and this could help to construct a healthy and safe social media environment. In this meaningful research area, one critical issue is robust and discriminative numerical representation learning of text messages. In this paper, we propose a new representation learning method to tackle this problem. Our method named semantic-enhanced marginalized denoising auto-encoder (smSDA) is developed via a semantic extension of the popular deep learning model stacked denoising autoencoder (SDA). The semantic extension consists of semantic dropout noise and sparsity constraints, where the semantic dropout noise is designed to randomly drop words or phrases.",

Sequential FIM algorithm suffers from performance deterioration when it operated on a huge amount of data on a single machine. To address this problem, parallel FIM algorithms were proposed.

    "title": "A Chaotic System Based Fragile Watermarking Scheme for Image Tamper Detection",
    "description": "This project proposes a novel chaos-based watermarking scheme for image authentication and tamper detection. The scheme can detect any modifications made to the image and indicate specific locations that have been modified. Two chaotic maps are employed to enhance security, ensuring the watermarking scheme can withstand counterfeiting attacks. The chaotic maps' sensitivity to initial values helps disturb the position relation between pixels in the watermarked image and the watermark.",

    "description": "This project presents Locality-constrained Linear Coding (LLC) as a coding scheme for image classification, replacing the VQ coding in traditional Spatial Pyramid Matching (SPM). LLC utilizes locality constraints to project each descriptor into its local-coordinate system, with the projected coordinates integrated by max pooling to generate the final representation. The proposed approach performs better than traditional nonlinear SPM, achieving state-of-the-art performance on several benchmarks and providing a fast-approximated LLC method using K-nearest-neighbor search.",

The S-DES algorithm is used to encrypt the secret message, and then the alteration component method hides the encrypted data in another medium. This dual approach of encrypting and concealing data aims to provide a high level of security against unauthorized access and interception.",
