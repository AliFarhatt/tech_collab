Sentiment analysis research focuses on understanding the positive or negative tone of a sentence based on sentence syntax, structure, and content. Previous research used a tree-based model to label sentence sentiment on a scale of 5 points. Our project takes a different approach of abstracting the sentence as a vector and applying vector classification schemes. We explore two components=> first, we would like to analyze the use of different sentence representations, such as bag of words, word sentiment location, negation, etc., and abstract them into a set of features. Second, we would like to classify sentence sentiment using this set of features and compare the effectiveness of different models.",

These emotions, together with people’s opinions, are in real-time reflected by tweets. As a result, by analyzing relevant tweets using proper machine learning algorithms, one could grasp the public’s sentiment as well as attitude towards the stock’s price of interest, which could intuitively predict the next move of it.

There is a possibility that this increased seismicity in CEUS is caused by anthropogenic processes and is referred to as induced or triggered seismicity. The earthquakes are a nuisance for people and some larger magnitude earthquakes have also caused structural damage. Hence, it is important to quantify seismic hazard and risk from this increased seismicity. One of the major components in determining seismic hazard and risk is the expected level of ground shaking at a site. Level of ground shaking from a given earthquake is typically estimated using previously collected ground motion data in a region. However, in CEUS, due to the increased seismic activity, a new predictive model is needed.",

Tactical play is the approach of calculating maneuvers and employing tactics that take advantage of short-term opportunities, while positional play is dominated by long-term maneuvers for advantage and requires judgement more than calculations. Current generation chess engines predominantly employ tactical play and thus outplay top human players given their much superior computational abilities. Engines do so by searching game trees of depths typically between 20 and 30 moves and calculating a large number of variations. However, human play is often a combination of both, tactical and positional approaches, since humans have some intuition about which board positions are intrinsically better than others. In our project, we use machine learning to identify elements of positional play.",

The Medicare Payment Advisory Commission has estimated that almost $12 billion is spent annually by Medicare on potentially preventable readmissions within 30 days of a patient’s discharge from a hospital. The Medicare program has begun to apply financial penalties to hospitals that have excessive risk-adjusted readmission rates. There is much interest in the health policy and medical communities in the ability to accurately predict which patients are at high risk of being readmitted. Not only are there strong financial reasons to avoid readmissions, readmission to the hospital can be a sign of poor clinical care and can indicate a worsening of a patient’s condition. If doctors and nurses were aware of which patients were at highest risk, they could focus their efforts on these patients and could improve coordination of care with post-acute providers and family physicians. There has been some interest in this problem in the machine learning community as well. The Heritage Health Competition was a predictive modeling competition with the objective of predicting hospital readmissions, with a $3 million cash prize. However, the dataset used for that competition was highly de-identified and thus was missing much of the key information useful for predictions. It also had a low number of patients who were generally healthy. In this project, we will apply machine learning methods to a dataset of Medicare claims to predict which patients are at a high risk of being readmitted to the hospital. We will then compare our results to the performance of risk adjustment models currently used by the Medicare program to predict readmissions.",

Increasing computing power allows the derivation of more complex features, giving us new information about each author’s linguistic signature and writing style.

In latent factor methods, both user and items are transformed into a latent feature space. An item is recommended to a user if they are similar, and their vector representation in the latent feature space is relatively high. We select latent factor model because it allows us to identify the hidden features of the users. These features are time-independent.",

Sharing on the web has become a major tool in expressing customer thoughts about a particular product or service. Recent years have seen rapid growth in online discussion groups and review sites (e.g., www.tripadvisor.com) where a crucial characteristic of a customer’s review is their sentiment or overall opinion — for example, if the review contains words like ‘great’, ‘best’, ‘nice’, ‘good’, ‘awesome’ is probably a positive comment. Whereas if reviews contain words like ‘bad’, ‘poor’, ‘awful’, ‘worse’ is probably a negative review. However, Trip Advisor’s star rating does not express the exact experience of the customer. Most of the ratings are meaningless, a large chunk of reviews falls in the middle.",

                    "description"=> "Wikipedia, the world's largest encyclopedia, is created by millions of unpaid editors online. Every user can edit every article, and the project is protected against vandalism and low-quality contributions only through version control and a system of (again unpaid) reviewers. Somewhat hidden to most casual readers of the encyclopedia, Wikipedia also features a simple social network=> every user has a personal user profile and a “user talk page” which acts as a publicly accessible guestbook where users can leave messages to each other. The messages exchanged in user talk pages are often related to a user’s editing behavior. For example, senior users may welcome new users, or congratulate them on their first edits. Administrators may officially warn culprits after transgressions of Wikipedia's content guidelines or policies. Users may also thank one another for certain edits, and, of course, users engage in heated debates about what the ground truth reflected in a certain article should be. Not all such debates are pleasant, although the community as a whole has been noted for its considerable resilience against both anarchy and uncontrolled aggression. Social feedback has long been known to be a strong influencer of intrinsic motivation. Observing praise and gratitude may be a strong incentive for Wikipedia editors to “keep up the good work,” whereas repeated unpleasant discussions, official warnings, or even personal insults may discourage further editing behavior. With this intuition in mind, we formulated our hypothesis=> we ask if received message sentiment can help predict editor activity on Wikipedia. In so doing, we create the opportunity to engage with frustrated editors—for example, motivating emails could be sent to users who are expected to significantly reduce their editing due to received message sentiment. If effective, this could increase overall editing activity (and editor happiness) on Wikipedia; for the scope of this paper we assume a high number of edits to be desirable, since it enables the encyclopedia to better reflect an ever-changing world.",

Understanding the rich landscape of moods will help us better interpret millions of individuals. This paper describes a Rule-Based approach, which detects the emotion or mood of the tweet and classifies the twitter message under the appropriate emotional category. The accuracy of the system is 85%. With the proposed system it is possible to understand the deeper levels of emotions, i.e., finer-grained instead of sentiment, i.e., coarse-grained.

The search for an empty parking spot can become an agonizing experience for the city’s urban drivers. A recent article claims that drivers cruising for a parking spot in SF generate 30% of all downtown congestion. These wasted miles not only increase traffic congestion, but also lead to more pollution and driver anxiety. In order to alleviate this problem, the city armed 7000 metered parking spaces and 12,250 garage spots (a total of 593 parking lots) with sensors and introduced a mobile application called SFpark, which provides real-time information about the availability of a parking lot to drivers. However, safety experts worry that drivers looking for parking may focus too much on their phone and not enough on the road. Furthermore, the current solution does not allow drivers to plan ahead of a trip. We wish to tackle the parking problem by (i) predicting the occupancy rate, defined as the number of occupied parking spots over the total number of spots, of parking lots in a zone given a future time and geolocation, (ii) working on aggregated parking lots to explore if there is an estimation error reduction pattern in occupancy prediction, and (iii) classifying daily parking occupancy patterns to investigate different travel behavior in different regions.",

It is thought that such an algorithm could be implemented in real-time with a wireless, implanted EEG sensor. However, there are two main constraints for such a portable system.

Examples include answering questions in political and social science (e.g., proving/disproving the existence of media bias and the “echo chamber” effect), using online social media to predict election outcomes, and personalizing social media feeds so as to provide a fair and balanced view of people’s opinions on controversial issues. A prerequisite for answering the above research questions is the ability to accurately estimate the political leaning of the population involved. If it is not met, either the conclusion will be invalid, the prediction will perform poorly due to a skew towards highly vocal or polarized groups.",

When data ambiguity cannot be reduced algorithmically, crowdsourcing proves a viable approach, which consists in posting tasks to humans and harnessing their judgment for improving the confidence about data values or relationships. This paper tackles the problem of processing top-K queries over uncertain data with the help of crowdsourcing to quickly converge to the real ordering of relevant results. Several offline and online approaches for addressing questions to a crowd are defined and contrasted on both synthetic and real datasets, with the aim of minimizing the crowd interactions necessary to find the real ordering of the result set.",

Machine learning techniques make automatic detection of bullying messages in social media possible, and this could help to construct a healthy and safe social media environment. In this meaningful research area, one critical issue is robust and discriminative numerical representation learning of text messages. In this paper, we propose a new representation learning method to tackle this problem. Our method named semantic-enhanced marginalized denoising auto-encoder (smSDA) is developed via a semantic extension of the popular deep learning model stacked denoising autoencoder (SDA). The semantic extension consists of semantic dropout noise and sparsity constraints, where the semantic dropout noise is designed to randomly drop words or phrases.",

Frequent itemset mining (FIM) is the core problem in association rule mining. Sequential FIM algorithm suffers from performance deterioration when it operated on a huge amount of data on a single machine. To address this problem, parallel FIM algorithms were proposed. There are two types of algorithms that can be used for mining the frequent itemsets=> the candidate-itemset generation approach and the approach without candidate itemset generation.",

PM2.5 refers to tiny particles in the air that reduce visibility and cause the air to appear hazy when levels are elevated. However, the relationships between the concentration of these particles and meteorological and traffic factors are poorly understood. To shed some light on these connections, some of these advanced techniques have been introduced into air quality research.

The Medicare Payment Advisory Commission has estimated that almost $12 billion is spent annually by Medicare on potentially preventable readmissions within 30 days of a patient’s discharge from a hospital. The Medicare program has begun to apply financial penalties to hospitals that have excessive risk-adjusted readmission rates. There is much interest in the health policy and medical communities in the ability to accurately predict which patients are at high risk of being readmitted. Not only are there strong financial reasons to avoid readmissions, readmission to the hospital can be a sign of poor clinical care and can indicate a worsening of a patient’s condition. If doctors and nurses were aware of which patients were at highest risk, they could focus their efforts on these patients and could improve coordination of care with post-acute providers and family physicians. There has been some interest in this problem in the machine learning community as well. The Heritage Health Competition was a predictive modeling competition with the objective of predicting hospital readmissions, with a $3 million cash prize. However, the dataset used for that competition was highly de-identified and thus was missing much of the key information useful for predictions. It also had a low number of patients who were generally healthy. In this project, we will apply machine learning methods to a dataset of Medicare claims to predict which patients are at a high risk of being readmitted to the hospital. We will then compare our results to the performance of risk adjustment models currently used by the Medicare program to predict readmissions.",

Well, our proposed project puts forward a hand gesture based system that allows the user to control the pc mouse movements through the use of hand movements. Our system uses a pc webcam to detect hand gesture movements. The system continuously scans the camera input for five-finger hand-like patterns. Once a hand is detected, the system then locks it as an object. A flag is set on the object in order to mark it as an object. After the object has been flagged and detected, our system then constantly records its movements in terms of X and Y direction movement based coordinates. These coordinates are then mapped to the cursor movements on the screen.",

Due to love of the game, and partly from the shame of being outdone by an octopus, we have decided to attempt to predict the outcomes of soccer matches. This has real-world applications for gambling, coaching improvements, and journalism. Out of the many leagues we could have chosen, we decided upon the English Premier League.",

For example, a human can easily tell whether a tweet is about a book or about a kitchen utensil. However, to write a rule-based computer program to solve this task, a programmer must lay down very precise criteria for these classifications. There has been a massive increase in the amount of structured user-generated content on the Internet in the form of tweets, reviews on Amazon and eBay, etc. As opposed to stand-alone companies, which leverage their own hubs of data to run behavioral analytics, we strive to gain insights into online user behavior and interests based on free and public data. By leveraging machine learning techniques, we aim to classify user behavior more accurately and efficiently.",

However, their ability to take Natural Language instructions is still in its infancy. Parsing, Semantic Interpretation and Dialogue Management are typically performed only on a limited set of primitives, thus limiting the set of instructions that could be given to a robot. This limits a robot’s applicability in unconstrained natural environments (like households and offices). In this project, we are only addressing the problem of semantic interpretation of human instructions. Specifically, our Extracto algorithm provides a method to extract potential actions (verbs) that could be performed given two household objects (nouns). For example, given the nouns “Coffee” and “Cup”, Extracto identifies the action (verb) “pour” indicating that ‘coffee should be poured into the cup’.",

Technology for Birds and their sounds are in many ways important for our culture. They can be heard even in big cities and most people can recognize at least a few most common species by their sounds.

Among various RF approaches, support-vector-machine (SVM)-based RF is one of the most popular techniques in CBIR. Despite the success, directly using SVM as an RF scheme has two main drawbacks. First, it treats the positive and negative feedbacks equally, which is not appropriate since the two groups of training feedbacks have distinct properties.

Previous research used a tree-based model to label sentence sentiment on a scale of 5 points. Our project takes a different approach of abstracting the sentence as a vector and apply vector classification schemes. We explore two components=> first, we would like to analyze the use of different sentence representations, such as bag of words, word sentiment location, negation, etc., and abstract them into a set of features. Second, we would like to classify sentence sentiment using this set of features and compare the effectiveness of…",

These emotions, together with people’s opinions, are in real-time reflected by tweets. As a result, by analyzing relevant tweets using proper machine learning algorithms, one could grasp the public’s sentiment as well as attitude towards the stock’s price of interest, which could intuitively predict the next move of it.

In latent factor methods, both user and items are transformed into a latent feature space. An item is recommended to a user if they are similar, their vector representation in the latent feature space is relatively high.

While these outputs can be used for tasks such as autonomous navigation, they lack any semantic information. Our project implements a modular object detection framework that can be used in conjunction with a SLAM engine to generate semantic scene reconstructions. A semantically-augmented reconstruction has many potential applications. Some examples include=> Discriminating between pedestrians, cars, bicyclists, etc in an autonomous driving system. Loop-closure detection based on object-level descriptors. Smart household bots that can retrieve objects given a natural language command. An object detection algorithm designed for these applications has a unique set of requirements and constraints. The algorithm needs to be…",

The search for an empty parking spot can become an agonizing experience for the city’s urban drivers. A recent article claims that drivers cruising for a parking spot in SF generate 30% of all downtown congestion. These wasted miles not only increase traffic congestion, but also lead to more pollution and driver anxiety. In order to alleviate this problem, the city armed 7000 metered parking spaces and 12,250 garages spots with sensors and introduced a mobile application called SFpark, which provides real-time information about the availability of a parking lot to drivers. However,…",

Unlike predicting market index (as explored by previous years’ projects), a single stock price tends to be affected by large noise and long-term trend inherently converges to the company’s market performance. So this project focuses on short-term (1-10 days) prediction of stock price trend and takes the approach of analyzing the time series indicators as features to classify trend (Raise or Down). The validation model is chosen so that the testing set always follows the training set in the time span to simulate real prediction. Cross-validated Grid Search on parameters of RBF-kernelized SVM is performed to fit the training data to balance the bias and variances.",

Specifically, such data reveal who spends time where, when, and on what type of activity (e.g., shopping at a mall, or dining at a restaurant). That information can, in turn, be used to describe city regions in terms of activity that takes place therein. For example, the data might reveal that citizens visit one region mainly for shopping in the morning, while another for dining in the evening. Furthermore, once such a description is available, one can ask more elaborate questions. For example, one might ask what features distinguish one region from another - some regions might be different in terms of the type of venues they have, the demographics of their visitors, or the times of day they are most active.",

In latent factor methods, both user and items are transformed into a latent feature space. An item is recommended to a user if they are similar, their vector representation in the latent feature space is relatively high.

There has been a massive increase in the amount of structured user-generated content on the Internet in the form of tweets, reviews on Amazon and eBay etc. As opposed to stand-alone companies, which leverage their own hubs of data to run behavioral analytics, we strive to gain insights into online user behavior and interests based on free and public data.

However, their ability to take Natural Language instructions is still in its infancy. Parsing, Semantic Interpretation and Dialogue Management are typically performed only on a limited set of primitives, thus limiting the set of instructions that could be given to a robot. This limits a robot’s applicability in unconstrained natural environments (like households and offices). In this project, we are only addressing the problem of semantic interpretation of human instructions. Specifically, our Extracto algorithm provides a method to extract potential actions (verbs) that could be performed given two household objects (nouns). For example, given the nouns “Coffee” and “Cup”, Extracto identifies the action (verb) “pour” indicating that ‘coffee should…",

Engines do so by searching game trees of depths typically between 20 and 30 moves and calculating a large number of variations.

Different parameter values can be extracted from the ECG waveforms and can be used along with other information about the patient like age, medical history, etc to detect arrhythmia. However, sometimes it may be difficult for a doctor to look at these long-duration ECG recordings and find minute irregularities.

So this project focuses on short-term (1-10 days) prediction of stock price trend and takes the approach of analyzing the time series indicators as features to classify trend (Raise or Down). The validation model is chosen so that the testing set always follows the training set in the time span to simulate real prediction.

The proposed solutions are mainly built on the Paillier public-key cryptosystem and can provide both location and query privacy. To preserve query privacy, our basic solution allows the mobile user to retrieve…",

Examples include answering questions in political and social science (e.g., proving/disproving the existence of media bias and the “echo chamber” effect), using online social media to predict election outcomes, and personalizing social media feeds so as to provide a fair and balanced view of people’s opinions on controversial issues. A prerequisite for answering the above research questions is the ability to accurately estimate the political leaning of the population involved.

So far, the research community has focused on detecting malicious posts and campaigns. In this paper, we ask the question=> Given a Facebook application, can we determine if it is malicious? Our key contribution is in developing FRAppE-Facebook's Rigorous Application Evaluator-arguably the first tool focused on detecting malicious apps on Facebook. To develop FRAppE, we use information gathered by observing the posting behavior of 111K Facebook apps seen across 2.2 million users on Facebook.",

For example, the data might reveal that citizens visit one region mainly for shopping in the morning, while another for dining in the evening. Furthermore, once such a description is available, one can ask more elaborate questions.
